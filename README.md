# WP-phpBB-bridge
Plugin that is used on nam-guild.com to connect Wordpress (5.x) and phpBB (3.0.14).

Originally created in 2010, and left alone except very minor changes. Wasn't properly worked on until a few days ago. Decided to make a proper repistory as of today (19th of August 2019). Will add more info later.
